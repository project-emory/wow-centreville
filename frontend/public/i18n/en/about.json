        "3": "We started as a small family business 18 years ago in a humble restaurant in Centerville. Our mother and owner, who values consistent flavors and puts her heart into every menu item, is now well over 70 years old, but her passion remains as strong as someone in their 20s. We believe that our journey from that small restaurant to where we are now was possible because our mother never entrusted the food to anyone else's hands. Now, through WOW Centreville, we aim to lend a helping hand to busy mothers. We promise to serve delicious meals made with fresh and high-quality ingredients. All dishes from WOW Centreville are prepared at WOW Fresh Meat, a fully licensed and certified kitchen.",
