# WOW Centreville Website

The frontend of the WOW Centreville app.

## Setup

1. Install [node & npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

2. Run `npm install`

## Miscellaneous

-   You can format your code by running `npm run format` and check any offending code by running `npm run lint`.
-   If new dependencies are added, you will have to re-run `npm install`.
-   When dealing with merge conflicts, you should NEVER touch package-lock.json. Instead, ignore the file and run `npm install` after resolving merge conflicts to regenerate package-lcok.json.
